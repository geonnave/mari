# build-schedules.sh - build one gateway net-core image per schedule.
#
# The gateway's schedule is a compile-time pointer (03app_gateway_net/main.c,
# `schedule_app`), so switching it means a rebuild. Nodes do not: they adopt
# whatever the beacon advertises (mari/mac.c, sync_to_gateway ->
# mr_scheduler_set_schedule), so only the gateway is ever reflashed.
#
# Building takes minutes and flashing takes seconds, so build all of them once
# and flash from the cache during a campaign:
#
#   ./build-schedules.sh                       # all four, into Output/schedules/
#   ./build-schedules.sh tiny huge             # just these
#   ./flash.sh gateway --all --net-hex Output/schedules/03app_gateway_net-tiny.hex
#
# main.c is edited in place and restored byte-for-byte from a copy taken up
# front, via an EXIT trap, so an interrupted run does not leave the source
# pointing at the wrong schedule. Uncommitted edits are preserved, not
# discarded - the bench net id lives in this very file, so that is the normal
# case rather than the exception.
#
# Env:
#   SEGGER_DIR    SES install (default: /opt/segger)
#   BUILD_CONFIG  SES config (default: Debug)
